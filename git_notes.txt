  Pull requests are how you merge branches on Github

# master branch is a label that git creates for us on
  initiliazation.

  Head is another labal that git creates for us when we create our first commit

  Head is *not* a branch

# creates a new branch
  git branch git-notes

# shows us active branch
  get notes
